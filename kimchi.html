            <h3 id="Section1">What is Kimchi?</h3>
            <p>Kimchi (김치) is a collective term for vegetable dishes that have been salted, seasoned, and fermented. The
                its
                history goes back to ancient times. Originated from pickled vegetables, there are now hundreds of kimchi
                varieties in Korea. You can find some of the most common ones in my 15 easy kimchi recipes.</p>
            <p>Over the last decade or so, Korean kimchi has gained a global recognition as a healthy probiotic food.
                It's a
                good source of useful lactic acid bacteria, has excellent anti-oxidation and anti-cancer effects, and
                helps
                prevent aging.</p>
            <p>This recipe is made with baechu (배추), known as napa cabbage, hence the name baechu kimchi. Because the
                cabbage is kept intact at its head, it's also known as pogi kimchi (포기김치). Pogi means a “head” of a
                vegetable.</p>

                <div>
                    <li>Cut the thick white part of the cabbage in half lengthwise. Then, slowly pull it apart to
                        separate into two pieces. Do the same for each half to make quarters. Running the knife through
                        all the way would unnecessarily cut off the cabbage leaves.</li>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <li>In a large bowl, dissolve 1/2 cup of salt in 5 cups of water. Thoroughly bathe each cabbage
                        quarter in the salt water one at a time, shake off excess water back into the bowl, and then
                        transfer to another bowl.</li>
                    <img src="https://www.koreanbapsang.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC6301-2-e1572930821384.jpg"

                </div>
                <div>
                    <li>Using the other half cup of salt and starting from the outermost leaf, generously sprinkle salt
                        over the thick white part of each leaf (similar to salting a piece of meat). Try to salt all the
                        cabbage quarters with 1/2 cup salt, but you can use a little more if needed. Repeat with the
                        rest of the cabbage quarters. Pour the remaining salt water from the first bowl over the
                        cabbage. Set aside for about 6 - 8 hours, rotating the bottom ones to the top every 2 - 3 hours.
                    </li>

                <div>
                    <li>The cabbages should be ready to be washed when the white parts of the leaves are bendable. It's
                        okay to have a bit of resistance. Rinse thoroughly 3 times, especially between the white parts.
                        Drain well, cut side down.</li>

                <div>
                    <li>Meanwhile, make the optional dasima broth by boiling a small piece (2 to 3 inch square) in 1.5
                        cups of water for 5 minutes, and cool. Mix the rice flour with 1/2 cup water (or optional dasima
                        broth) and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until it thickens to a thin paste, and
                        cool. Yields about 3 - 4 tablespoons.</li>

                <div>
                    <li>Prepare the garlic, ginger and saeujeot. Combine all the seasoning ingredients, including the
                        rice paste and about 1/2 cup water (or the optional dashima broth), and mix well. Set aside
                        until the gochugaru dissolves slightly and becomes pasty.</li>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <li>Cut the radish and optional pear into matchsticks (use a mandoline if desired), transferring to
                        a large bowl. Cut the scallions diagonally into about 1-inch long pieces. Add the prepared
                        seasoning mix to the radish, and mix well by hand. Throw in the scallions, and mix everything
                        lightly. Taste a little bit. It should be a little too salty to eat as is. You can add salt,
                        more salted shrimp or fish sauce, as needed. Let it sit for about 30 minutes to allow the
                        flavors to meld nicely.</li>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <li>Cut off the tough stem part from each cabbage quarter, leaving enough to hold the leaves
                        together. Place one cabbage quarter in the bowl with the radish mix. Spread the radish mix over
                        each leaf, one to two tablespoons for large leaves. (Eyeball the stuffing into 4 parts and use
                        one part for each cabbage quarter.)</li>
                    <img src="https://www.koreanbapsang.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/kimchi-recipe-step-7-e1431839970965.jpg"

                </div>
                <div>
                    <li>Fold the leaf part of the cabbage over toward the stem and nicely wrap it with the outermost
                        leaf. Place it, cut side up, in a jar or airtight container. Repeat with the remaining cabbages.
                        If you have loose large leaves, you can use them to cover the top of the kimchi (see note 1).
                        Once all the cabbages are in the jar or airtight container, press down hard to remove air
                        pockets. To collect any remaining seasoning, rinse the bowl with 1/2 cup of water (or the
                        remaining optional dasima broth), and add it to the kimchi container. Close the lid.</li>

                <div>
                    <li>Leave it out at room temperature for a full day or two. It can be longer, depending on the
                        weather and how fast you want your kimchi to ripen. Then, store in the fridge. (see note 2)</li>

                        especially for this small batch of kimchi.</li>
