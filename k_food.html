          <h3>Main dishes</h3>
          <h4>Bulgogi</h4>
          <p>
            Bulgogi (Korean: 불고기), literally "fire meat" is a Korean-style
            grilled or roasted dish made of thin, marinated slices of meat, most
            commonly beef, grilled on a barbecue or on a stove-top griddle. It
            is also often stir-fried in a pan in home cooking. Sirloin, rib eye
            or brisket are frequently used cuts of beef for the dish. Very
            popular in South Korea, it can be found anywhere from upscale
            restaurants to local supermarkets as pan-ready kits.
          </p>

          <h4>Bibimbap</h4>
          <p>
            Bibimbap (Korean: 비빔밥) is a Korean rice dish with bibim meaning
            "mixing" and bap "cooked rice". It is served as a bowl of warm white
            rice topped with sautéed or blanched seasoned vegetables and chili
            pepper paste. Egg and sliced meat are common additions, stirred
            together thoroughly just before eating. In 2017, the dish was listed
            at number 40 on the World's 50 most delicious foods from readers'
            poll compiled by CNN Travel.
