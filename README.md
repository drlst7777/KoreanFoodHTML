TechLabs HTML Challenge - Lydie Kouang &amp; Andreas Landes

:point_right: Here’s the task: Make a simple page using HTML about something you’re passionate about (art, cats, web development, sports, food, ...).This is to practice HTML, the CSS challenge will be next!
So use only HTML without any CSS (this includes inline styling).

:white_check_mark: Rules (Must Have):
Must use appropriate HTML tags for your content (don’t use <div> for everything)
Must contain at least one list
Must contain at least a few images
Must contain a link to an external page (bonus points if you get the page to open in a new tab)
Must contain a form <-- no hard specifics for this, just make sure there’s at least two inputs, which are labelled and a button!

If you should have time and energy, some additional ideas (this is completely optional):
Use an HTML tag (or two!) that are not introduced in Colt’s course
Use a table
use different input types in your form
create a second page and navigation between the pages
put in whatever is fun for you!

Hint - we will be paying attention to code format. You can use a handy extension like VSCode’s Prettier to auto format your code!: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode
